# softbody-evolution
## **Modelling the growth of a soft-body system from a single cell and temporal adaptation to the environment**

This project presents the adaptation process of a soft-body system based on the spring interactions between the cells that make up the system, to the user-defined environment. The soft-body system is generated by consecutive mitosis a single-cell system whereas the environment includes desired and undesired regions. The cells undergo apoptosis under certain conditions: two cells overlapping each other, a cell that is not interacting with another cells, and the cells that positioned on the undesired regions. If none of the conditions for apoptosis is met, the cells that have interactions less than a predetermined value undergo mitosis and newborn cells are generated. This project further investigates the effect of cell diameter on adaptation process. 


$x(t+\Delta t) = x(t) +v(t)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(t)\Delta t^2$

$v(t+\Delta t) = v(t) + \frac{1}{2}[a(t)+a(t+\Delta t)] \Delta t$
